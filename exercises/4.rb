# Append 11 to the end of the array. Prepend 0 to the beginning 

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

arr << 11 # or arr.push(11) using push method 

p arr

arr.unshift(0) # unshift method prepends and array 

p arr

# Great job! Remember unshift prepends an array. There is always an answer. Use ruby documentation to determine the method or create your own!
